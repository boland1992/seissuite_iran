v<0.1.3>, <07.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

1. plot_SNR gives all SNR vs. time plots correctly in same figure. Now built-in to pscrosscorr, plot_SNR.py is no longer in use. 
2. REMOVE_HIGHAMP works correctly. Word of caution, it make the code run about 10x slower due to heavy processing requirements. 
   e.g. calculating the characteristic function for all database time-series information.  


v<0.1.29>, <07.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

1. RESP_CHECK correctly removes instruments from each station that do not meet the RESP_CHECK requirements as set in the .cnf files.
2. The response database now correctly saves gain vs. frequency curve information correctly into the response.db SQL database.
3. The response.db SQL database now has a resp_window table which contains information required for the RESP_CHECK operations.

v<0.1.28>, <07.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

1. Application can now successfully automate multiple configurations in one run.

v<0.1.27>, <04.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

1. Configuration files now have separate directory. 
2. Configuration files now have options of which prepropcessing steps you wish to perform.



v<0.1.26>, <04.09.2015> -- Changes list: 

Major changes completed!

1. 00_setup.py script functions to build the initial file structure correctly.
2. Bugs with 01_database_init.py script have been worked out and for now it's creating the SQL 
databases correctly. 
3. Issues with psprepocess.py script have been resolved.
4. XCORR calculations are no longer yielding incorrect results as a result of improper initialisation of self.dataarray, self.phase_stack and self.pws variables in the Crosscorrelation class in pscrosscorr.py in seissuite.ant
5. Creation of SNR list with time. This will give the user the opportunity to see how quickly or slowly the processing methods they have chosen are coverging on a desired signal!
6. Other things that I've likely forgotten. This application is still incredibly new and I'm currently running through as many examples and tests that I can think of. Flailing about like a headless chicken!
