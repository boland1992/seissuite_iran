    "SeisSuite, a python package extension focused on ambient noise seismological methods and developments. \n",
    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "by Benjamin Boland and Louis Moresi \n",
    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##Introduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code presented in this paper was created in order to address \n",
    "needs associated with processing ambient noise methods in seismology. \n",
    "The code is largely based on several python packages that already \n",
    "exist to assist with seismology. Though many non-standard python \n",
    "packages are used, specifically Obspy, MSNoise and Seismic-Noise-Tomography \n",
    "(insert code references here) are the building blocks for SeisSuite. \n",
    "Other ambient noise seismology python packages have also been \n",
    "developed, such as ANTS and Whisper (insert code references \n",
    "here) but for reasons outlined below, these were are not ideal \n",
    "for the user and were not chosen as base-line codes to build upon. \n",
    "The need for SeisSuite is also addressed, as existing programmes \n",
    "for processing ambient noise seismic methods have their pitfalls \n",
    "that SeisSiute has attempted to address. \n",
    "\n",
    "SeisSuite builds upon key principals for improving ambient \n",
    "noise processing methods. These principals are: \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the programme had to be open-source for help with development, \n",
    "as well as allowing it to be a widely acceptable tool for seismologists \n",
    "to use in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the code was written with ease of installation and processing \n",
    "set-up in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, rapid and accessible development of new tools for other \n",
    "users to add if they so desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, the ability to explore and expand upon the ideas of ambient \n",
    "noise seismology station site survey design and optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Why develop SeisSuite? \n",
    "\n",
    "SeisSuite was developed because a need was sought for a more generalised, \n",
    "easy installation and relatively rapid additional development \n",
    "ambient noise seismology programme. Below the problems with \n",
    "existing ambient noise seismology programmes is identified \n",
    "which led to the conclusion that another additional set of codes \n",
    "were necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. MSNoise \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Whisper Project \n",
    "\n",
    "3. ANTS \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Seismic-Noise-Tomography \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Additional individual projects e.g. Mallory Young and ANU's code for ambient noise seismology. \n",
    "\n",
    "MSNoise provides easy installation and set-up with its clever \n",
    "use of a configuration GUI and a standardised python setup.py \n",
    "installation file. The problem that was identified with MSNoise \n",
    "is two-fold: first is that MSNoise requires the use of a standardised \n",
    "file name and folder formatting structure. Though it has chosen \n",
    "standardised types, the use of this means that all downloaded \n",
    "raw waveform files must be converted to this format before the \n",
    "data can be processed. This usually involves writing another \n",
    "python script and can be costly in terms of time. This can also \n",
    "be frustrating if the user has yet to deal with files structures \n",
    "such as BUDS before. The second problem with MSNoise is its focus. \n",
    "The code was developed with continuous waveform monitoring \n",
    "of volcanic sources in mind. This is fine for near real-time monitoring \n",
    "of volcanic hazards, but is very difficult to adapt to other ambient \n",
    "noise methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "{text:soft-page-break} \n",
    "\n",
    "The European Whisper project has made strides in increasing \n",
    "the speed and accuracy of ambient noise seismological processing. \n",
    "Its focus is largely on broad ambient noise seismic monitoring \n",
    "internationally through the use of ambient noise methods. However, \n",
    "there were some issues when choosing to use Whisper. The first \n",
    "is access. This project is not strictly open-source, and therefore \n",
    "it took an email to the original developers and a wait-time of \n",
    "several weeks before the code could be obtained. Installation \n",
    "was also an issue. The time taken for this was extensive. Though \n",
    "the gains for processing speeds were great, but code could not \n",
    "be developed upon further for licensing issues. In theory, Whisper \n",
    "could be the best for ambient noise processing in the future. \n",
    "However, until it becomes open-source and allows developers \n",
    "from outside of their project to ultimately critique and improve \n",
    "upon the code, it will again have the same problem that MSNoise \n",
    "has. This is that its narrowly focused and not ideal for developing \n",
    "new methods in ambient noise seismology. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the time since start SeisSuite the documentation explaining \n",
    "the use of ANTS has improved, but is still somewhat challenging \n",
    "to a general user that the installation has not been explained \n",
    "to extensively. The scripts are solo and not associated with \n",
    "individuals tools developed for ANTS and the decision to skip \n",
    "this programme was made early on. From second-hand accounts, \n",
    "the views of those who have installed and operated ANTS have had \n",
    "a positive experience, but this was not the case for other users \n",
    "and this prompted the development of SeisSuite. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the points raised above, SeisSuite also focuses \n",
    "on survey design and optimisation, for which no previous code \n",
    "had been yet identified. All code related to seismological survey \n",
    "design and network station spacing has previously been associated \n",
    "with active seismic sources such as earthquake event seismology, \n",
    "or triggered event (e.g. explosives, or air-gun sourced) exploration \n",
    "seismology (find references associated with survey design \n",
    "for these types of seismology). \n",
    "\n",
    "##Survey design and optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Streamlining Installation and set-up. \n",
    "\n",
    "SeisSuite is developed with work-flow stream-lining and ease \n",
    "of set-up and installation in mind. While there are currently \n",
    "still bugs in the system of installation, the experience already \n",
    "adheres to the python packaging guidelines as set in (insert \n",
    "reference/s related to streamlining and PyPi packaging guidelines \n",
    "and installation). It is readily available on GitHub at github.com/boland1992/seissuite, \n",
    "and available to be forked, cloned and have branches edited in \n",
    "a collaborated Open-Source coding environment. SNT and ANTS \n",
    "follow the same version controlled guidelines, however, they \n",
    "are not packaged for easy installation and set-up like {text:soft-page-break} \n",
    "SeisSuite is, and this can save a considerable amount of time \n",
    "when it comes to wanting to do an ambient noise survey. PyPi is \n",
    "the pip python packaging project and is an index of developed \n",
    "python modules. SeisSuite modular streamlined file structure, \n",
    "allows for just the separate and most widely used functions and \n",
    "classes to be utilised without the need to download the entire \n",
    "github project. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Installation.\n",

    "The folder structure of the programme works as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Binaries or scripts are placed in the bin/ directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The build/ directory holds ***insert information about the \n",
    "build folder here*** \n",
    "\n",
    "{text:soft-page-break} 3. The dist/ directory is automated \n",
    "by python's dist-utils module and contains previous versions \n",
    "of the programme for installation if desired. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The docs/ directory contains documentation, including examples \n",
    "and how-tos with explanations of how the software works. This \n",
    "directory is, always and always will be, a work in progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. the seissuite/ directory contains all module and library \n",
    "file .py scripts that are most commonly used by the scripts in \n",
    "the bin/ directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Though not well populated at the time of writing this, the test/ \n",
    "directory has been created in the hopes that this programme will \n",
    "eventually be extensively unit-tested in order to increase \n",
    "the validity, and decrease the number of total errors that are \n",
    "being seen by the end-users. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have confirmed that the folder structure is in order, \n",
    "run the installation programme through the python dist-utils \n",
    "module file setup.py: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ python setup.py install \n",
    "\n",
    "This command will install the seissuite module into the default \n",
    "python site-packages directory of the user and these can then \n",
    "be called independent of where the calling scripts are located. \n",
    "If any modules are playing up and will not work as desired, a simple \n",
    "re-run of python setup.py install after changing one of the module \n",
    "scripts contained in seissuite/seissuite/ e.g. ant, misc etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is it! Once all of those operations have been run, you are \n",
    "now ready to use SeisSuite. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyPi (pip) Installation: \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have pip installed on your machine already, then simply \n",
    "run: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ pip install seissuite \n",
    "\n",
    "This will install everything in the seissuite module file from \n",
    "the folder structure outlined above. For example seissuite.ant, \n",
    "seissuite.misc and the others. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not yet have pip installed, please do so before running \n",
    "the above command. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Configuration simplification and work-flow flexibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "Simplification of use and work-flow is ideal for performing \n",
    "an ambient noise survey quickly and efficiently. SeisSuite \n",
    "aims to do this through the use of a folders structure set-up script \n",
    "named: (name is subject to change) and with the use of configuration \n",
    "files located in the bin/configs directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, take place any and all of the configurations you wish \n",
    "to be processed in the configs folder. They can be batch processed \n",
    "and more than one can be run by the 02_timeseries_process.py \n",
    "main programme script at a time. If more than one configuration \n",
    "file is in the configs folder at the time of running, they will \n",
    "be processed in alphabetical order. An example configuration \n",
    "file can be found in the appendix and contains explanations of \n",
    "variables and settings that can be used with SeisSuite. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 00_setup.py script should be run after at least one configuration \n",
    "file has been set-up in the configs directory. This script creates \n",
    "the correct output folder structure in the output directory \n",
    "you have chosen in the configuration file. Again this helps with \n",
    "knowing exactly where all outputs will be headed once the programme \n",
    "has been run, which speeds up the time of development without \n",
    "having to specify many different directories. \n",
    "\n",

    "waveform data and metadata in the form of Dataless SEED or Station \n",
    "XML are supported. This is subject to change. \n",
    "\n",
    "SeisSuite has the added benefit of smart data selection over \n",
    "its counterparts. Once a new data set and metadata have been placed \n",
    "into the INPUT/DATA and either INPUT/XML or INPUT/DATALESS \n",
    "folders respectively, then the programme initiates a reference \n",
    "SQL database. The database has many tables, and a full explanation \n",
    "can be found in the docs/ directory of seissuite. Each miniSEED \n",
    "file's headers are opened and file location and file trace start \n",
    "and end times are stored in the database. This means that instead \n",
    "of having to worry about folder structure, file-length or any \n",
    "other changes to the input data format e.g. BUDS or SDS structures \n",
    "are unnecessary. This saves considerable time in not having \n",
    "to write individual scripts to automate this process for every \n",
    "new dataset that comes in. All that has to be ensured is that the \n",
    "data is in miniSEED format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once run, the 02_timeseries_process.py script checks to see \n",
    "if a given data set configuration already has a a reference database. \n",
    "If not, these are initialised and then the cross-correlation \n",
    "programme may search through this very quickly using the SQL \n",
    "protocol to find what data it must process at what time. It also \n",
    "has the benefit of already knowing that there is data there that \n",
    "can be processed and this minimises false openings and errors \n",
    "associated with low data completeness in the running cross-correlations. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the database is large, for example: circa 1TB, then database \n",
    "initialisation may take some time. Please be patient in this \n",
    "instance. \n",

    "##Ambient Noise Survey Seismic Station Spacing Optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is little evidence that the spacings for many new seismic \n",
    "networks are focused on producing results from ambient noise \n",
    "methods. The primary focus of seismic networks vary. Some examples \n",
    "are: active reflection seismic surveys and continuous monitoring \n",
    "for earthquake and micro-seismic events. Producing results \n",
    "from ambient noise surveys, is not yet a primary focus for any \n",
    "known seismic network installations as of the date of this study. \n",
    "While this is not likely to change, it is a good idea to explore \n",
    "all avenues of potential outputs when building a new seismic \n",
    "network. In this regard, results from ambient noise should certainly \n",
    "be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "SeisSuite aims to assist in statistically optimising and constraining \n",
    "new seismic network station site locations for use with ambient \n",
    "noise methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Point density distributions are used \n",
    "as a proxy to find the optimised station spacing to give the highest \n",
    "possible resolution for a given set number of stations in a confined \n",
    "targeted survey field area. A point density distribution is \n",
    "found by taking the great-circle line between each station pair \n",
    "in the network. Then filters associated with known maximum attenuation \n",
    "distances are input by the user. 1000km is the default input here. \n",
    "Then points are placed with a set number per kilometre are placed \n",
    "along the great-circle line. Once a grid with a certain box size \n",
    "is set by the user, then a point density per box can be estimated. \n",
    "Boxes within the grid that have a higher point density are used \n",
    "to constrain ambient noise tomographic inversion images, therefore \n",
    "they can be used alone to proxy velocity map resolutions and even \n",
    "network station spacing distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 2** shows the point density distribution of the current \n",
    "networks available on the Incorporated Research Institutes \n",
    "for Seismomlogy's (IRIS) database. This distribution of stations \n",
    "have been declustered to have a representative station for every \n",
    "0.1 degree or circa 10km minimum spacing in order to avoid small \n",
    "scale network clusters affecting the overall continental scale \n",
    "distribution. SeisSuite has the functionality to statistically \n",
    "find a set of N new stations to add to this network by finding the \n",
    "centres of areas of lowest point density and running multiple \n",
    "iterations until the user is satisfied with the new point density \n",
    "distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 3** shows results performed with SeisSuite for designing \n",
    "an optimised station spacing with ambient noise methods for \n",
    "the Australian continent. The result is a station spacing that \n",
    "has 144 evenly distributed seismic stations, and from this comes \n",
    "a much more evenly spaced network for use with increasing the \n",
    "resolution of tomographic velocity images, or even potentially \n",
    "detecting seismic events across the field space. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 1:** Station pair great-circle path \n",
    "density point distribution of seismic stations available on \n",
    "IRIS for the Australian continent. These include stations sourced \n",
    "from the Australian Nation Seismic Network (AU) and the Australian \n",
    "Seismometers in Schools Network (S). The number of boxes or “bins” \n",
    "is a 200x200 grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Figure 2:** Point density distribution from statistically \n",
    "evenly spaced seismic stations. N is the number of stations and \n",
    "was taken to be 144 in this case. This is the number of currently \n",
    "operated stations in Australia on IRIS for the combined the AU \n",
    "- S network. The number of boxes or “bins” is a 200x200 grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the future for this optimised spacing would also \n",
    "include GIS location data such as: locations of roads, streams, \n",
    "power lines and other sources of potentially signal-dampening \n",
    "noise. When these, and other local noise source constraints \n",
    "are taken into account, then the choices for new station sites \n",
    "would decrease, allowing for fewer difficult station site location \n",
    "decisions to be made by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "##Conclusions and Extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SeisSuite has the following important additions \n",
    "of note: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistically optimised ambient noise seismic survey station \n",
    "spacing. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. GitHub and pip quick installation and version control with \n",
    "a proper modular pythonic structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Simplified configuration file settings and additional pre-processing \n",
    "options (turn them on and off at start-up). \n",
    "\n",
    "4. SQL reference database to enable \n",
    "generalised data calling regardless of file length and input \n",
    "folder structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Full options to enable the choice for either serialisation \n",
    "or parallelisation of: trace merging, pre-processing, cross-correlation, \n",
    "stacking and FTAN dispersion curve analysis steps. This can \n",
    "allow python to utilise all of the processing power on a giving \n",
    "workstation. MPI support for cluster computing is currently \n",
    "under development for even faster ambient noise survey processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Support for statistically optimising the station spacing \n",
    "for both: adding to existing seismic networks, and creating \n",
    "a new network from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are still additions to this programme to be developed. \n",
    "In the end, the final product should be able to optimise where \n",
    "to place the additional stations to existing seismic networks, \n",
    "as well as provide ideal site locations for new networks. This \n",
    "will be achieved through a combination of the code that has already \n",
    "been developed, and many more additional constraints to these \n",
    "locations. So far, the code can only process ideal station site \n",
    "based on area geometry and point-density spacings (see section \n",
    "etc) , and does not account for many real-world constraints to \n",
    "seismic stations, and in particular their relationship to ambient \n",
    "noise methods. A few examples of these real-world constraints \n",
    "are: the distance of a station to their respective cross-correlation \n",
    "pair station, the station's proximity to high-amplitude noise \n",
    "sources that are not ideal for ambient noise studies, such as \n",
    "power-lines, high-use roads, trains, and then the ease of installation \n",
    "for any given new station. These and other factors that can be \n",
    "added all should decrease the number of ideal sites to place any \n",
    "new seismic station to collect data for ambient noise seismology. \n",
